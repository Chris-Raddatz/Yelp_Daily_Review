# Yelp_Daily_Review
Script that collects top restaurants in Austin, TX area and sorts by distance from my parent's house

Used Windows Task Scheduler to run daily, analyzed after 75 days of collection from March - June 2023. 

Used PostgreSQL to upload data into database, accessed that through Microsoft Power BI and created dashboard viewing specific restaurant information and summary statistics.
